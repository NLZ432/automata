/*
From Simple Rules, Infinity
--------------------------
In cells that shift like cosmic dust,
Each pattern flows from rules we trust.
Like stars that dance in endless space,
Simple laws set time's own pace.
From Conway's Game to cosmic seas,
We glimpse the grand complexities
Where patterns spawn infinityâ€”
A universe of you and me.
